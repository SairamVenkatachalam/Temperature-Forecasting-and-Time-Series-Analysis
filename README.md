# üìà Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

## üìä Project Overview
This project delves into the systematic application of **time series analysis** to uncover the dynamics of sequentially ordered data and enable data-driven decision-making. By identifying hidden patterns, trends, and seasonality, the project builds predictive models to forecast future outcomes with enhanced accuracy.

The insights derived from this analysis have broad applicability across industries, including **financial forecasting**, **inventory management**, **climate modeling**, and **healthcare analytics**. Through a structured approach combining statistical techniques, model fitting, and diagnostic evaluations, the project demonstrates the transformative power of time series methodologies in converting raw temporal data into actionable insights.

## üéØ Objectives
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncover trends, seasonality, and underlying patterns in time-dependent datasets.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to identify dominant patterns while reducing noise.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - **Time series decomposition**: Separate time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
  - **Generalized Autocorrelation analysis**: Investigate relationships between past and present values to detect lags and dependencies.
  - **Stationarity tests**: Use tests like the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)** to check for stationarity ‚Äî a key assumption for many time series models.
- **Model Fitting**:
  - **Autoregressive models** such as **ARIMA** to capture temporal dependencies.
  - Evaluate models based on residual diagnostics to ensure statistical validity.
- **Residual Analysis**:
  - Test forecast residuals for **Gaussian white noise** behavior to validate model assumptions and identify unexplained variance.
- **Forecasting**: Leverage insights from fitted models to predict future values and assess accuracy using backtesting.

## üöÄ Methodology

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Visualized raw time series data to detect patterns, seasonal trends, and irregularities.
   - Applied **rolling statistics** and **moving averages** to highlight fluctuations.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Implemented **PCA** to capture the most influential components driving time series variations.
   - Reduced noise by isolating key temporal patterns.

3. **Time Series Decomposition**:
   - Broke down time series data into:
     - **Trend**: Long-term upward or downward movement.
     - **Seasonality**: Repeated patterns at regular intervals.
     - **Residuals**: Irregular fluctuations not explained by trend or seasonality.

4. **Statistical Testing**:
   - Conducted **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)** tests to check for stationarity.
   - Used **Generalized Partial Autocorrelation  (GPAC)** to identify significant lags and dependencies.

5. **Model Building**:
   - Fitted **Autoregressive models** including **AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA**.
   - Tuned model parameters (p, d, q) using **ACF** and **PACF** plots.

6. **Residual Diagnostics**:
   - Tested residuals for **Gaussian white noise** properties (mean zero, constant variance, and lack of autocorrelation).
   - Ensured models adhered to statistical assumptions before proceeding with forecasts.

7. **Forecasting**:
   - Produced future predictions based on trained models.
   - Evaluated accuracy using metrics like **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** and **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**.
